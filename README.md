## Goal
___
My goal for this challenge is to push myself out of my comfort zone, learn new skills, and ultimately become a better frontend developer. By committing to this challenge for 100 days, I hope to solidify my knowledge of the core technologies of frontend development and develop a deeper understanding of how they work together.

Thank you for checking out my project and I hope that my journey inspires you to push yourself as well.
